## Introduction

RoleAssign specifically allows site administrators to further delegate the task of managing user's roles while withholding the _Administer permissions_ permission.

RoleAssign introduces a new permission called _Assign roles_. Users with this permission are able to assign selected roles to still other users. Only users with the _Administer permissions_ permission may select which roles are available for assignment through this module.

RoleAssign is ideal for smaller sites with a system administrator and one assistant administrator role that should be reasonably restricted in what it allows. For larger sites with multiple levels of administrators or whenever you need finer-grained control over which role can assign which other role, check out [Role Delegation](https://www.drupal.org/project/role_delegation). See [#961682: Does the role delegation module supersede this module?](https://www.drupal.org/project/roleassign/issues/961682) for a short discussion of the relative merits of the two modules.

This module was developped by TBarregren and is now maintained by salvis.
Drupal 7 port by salvis.
Drupal 8 port by svendecabooter and tkuldeep17.

## Background

It is possible for site administrators to delegate the user administration through the _Administer users_ permission. But that doesn't include the right to assign roles to users. That is necessary if the delegatee should be able to administrate user accounts without intervention from a site administrator.

To delegate the assignment of roles, site administrators have had until now no other choice than also grant the _Administer permissions_ permission. But that is not advisable, since it gives right to access all roles, and worse, to grant any rights to any role. That can be abused by the delegatee, who can assign himself all rights and thereby take control over the site.

This module solves this dilemma by introducing the _Assign roles_ permission. While editing a user's account information, a user with this permission will be able to select roles for the user from a set of available roles. Roles available are configured by users with the _Administer permissions_ permission.

CodeKarate has a [nice introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_DnhKbcpVc) showing how to use RoleAssign.

## Requirements

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.

## Installation

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.

## Configuration

1. Log in as a Site Administrator.
2. Navigate to People > Permissions (/admin/people/permissions)
3. Grant the _Assign roles_ permission to roles that should be able to assign roles for other users
    - **Note:** These roles also must have the _Administer users_ permission
4. Navigate to People > Role assign (/admin/people/roleassign)
5. Select roles that should be available for to be assigned by users with the _Assign roles_ permission
6. Navigate to a user's edit page
7. Grant that user a role that has the _Assign roles_ and _Administer users_ permissions
8. Repeat Step 6 to 7 for all applicable users

## Usage

1. Log in as a user with that has the _Assign roles_ and _Administer users_ permissions
2. Navigate to a user's edit page
3. Review the Assignable roles and modify them, as necessary
4. Save the user

## Usage Notes

- The _Administer users_ permission is and remains a security-critical permission that must NOT be given to untrusted users!
- Granting the _Administer users_ permission to users will allow them to modify admin passwords or email addresses. The [User Protect](https://www.drupal.org/project/userprotect) module can help to prevent this. RoleAssign will protect user 1's name, email, and password fields, but it won't protect any other accounts.
- RoleAssign will keep your assistant admins within their limits, but if you introduce alternative ways to edit users, assign roles, or give permissions (like the "Administration: Users" view in the popular Administration Views module), then you may be opening up ways for your assistant admins to gain additional privileges.
